# Apps SDK Examples Documentation

## Overview

This page introduces end-to-end examples for the Apps SDK, with the Pizzaz demo app serving as the primary reference implementation.

## Key Points

**Purpose**: "The Pizzaz demo app bundles a handful of UI components so you can see the full tool surface area end-to-end."

The documentation walks developers through:
- MCP server implementations
- Component implementations powering the available tools

## Resource Location

Example code and applications are maintained in the [openai-apps-sdk-examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples).

## Guidance for Developers

The examples function as templates and starting points. Developers should reference these implementations as blueprints when creating their own applications.

## Navigation Context

This page appears in the Apps SDK documentation structure under the "Build" section, following the state management guide and preceding deployment instructions.
