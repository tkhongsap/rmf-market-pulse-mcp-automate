# Apps SDK Examples

## Overview
The Apps SDK provides example applications to demonstrate implementation patterns and best practices.

## Main Example: Pizzaz Demo App

The documentation references a **"Pizzaz demo app"** that demonstrates the full tool surface area end-to-end. As described: *"The Pizzaz demo app bundles a handful of UI components so you can see the full tool surface area end-to-end."*

## Key Resources

**GitHub Repository**: The primary examples are located in the [openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples](https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples) repository on GitHub.

## What the Examples Cover

The documentation indicates these examples illustrate:

1. **MCP Server implementation** - How to set up and configure the server backend
2. **Component implementations** - UI component patterns and usage
3. **Tool integration** - How tools are assembled and connected

## Purpose

These examples serve as *"blueprints when you assemble your own app."* They're designed to help developers understand patterns for building their own applications.

## Using Examples

When building your own app, reference these examples to understand:
- Complete MCP server configuration
- Component architecture and patterns
- Tool definition and integration
- State management approaches
- Authentication flows
