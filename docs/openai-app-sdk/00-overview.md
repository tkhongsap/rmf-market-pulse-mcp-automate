# OpenAI Apps SDK Overview

## Core Purpose
The Apps SDK is OpenAI's framework enabling developers to build applications that extend ChatGPT's capabilities. Currently in preview, the platform will open for app submissions later in 2025.

## Getting Started Path
The documentation outlines three main phases:

1. **Plan**: Research use cases and define tools for your application
2. **Build**: Set up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and create custom user experiences
3. **Deploy**: Launch your app and connect it to ChatGPT

## Key Concepts
- **MCP Server**: The foundational architecture for apps
- **User Interaction**: How users engage with your app within ChatGPT
- **Design Guidelines**: Creating components and flows native to ChatGPT's interface

## Important Resources
- **App Developer Guidelines**: Quality, safety, and policy standards
- **Design Guidelines**: Best practices for intuitive user experiences
- **Security & Privacy Guide**: Critical considerations for data handling
- **Troubleshooting**: Support for integration issues

## Additional Guidance
The platform emphasizes "design for quality" with dedicated resources on metadata optimization and security considerations to ensure apps meet OpenAI's standards before public availability.
